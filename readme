** This is a modified unofficial version of Plank made for use with i3. The problem with running plank with i3 was the height reserved for Plank animations. Therefor I have reduced this in the PositionManager.vala. as a result Plank is only reserving space with the window managerfor its actual height. Use it at your own risk **

** Disclamer: I'm not a memeber of the Plank development team!**

 
What Is Plank?

Plank is meant to be the simplest dock on the planet. The goal is to provide
just what a dock needs and absolutely nothing more. It is, however, a library
which can be extended to create other dock programs with more advanced features.

(Codenames for releases are currently based on characters of "Ed, Edd n Eddy".)
